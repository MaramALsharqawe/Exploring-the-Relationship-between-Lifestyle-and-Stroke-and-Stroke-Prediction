# Exploring-the-Relationship-between-Lifestyle-and-Stroke-and-Stroke-Prediction

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. There are many risk factors for stroke, including age, gender, smoking, and lifestyle choices. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and smoking can have a significant impact on the risk of stroke.

This project was conducted to build a logistic regression model that can predict stroke. The model was trained on a dataset of individual features, including age, gender, smoking status, etc. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 94%, meaning it correctly predicted whether or not an individual would have a stroke. The model can help doctors identify individuals at high risk of stroke, which can help improve the prevention and treatment of stroke.
